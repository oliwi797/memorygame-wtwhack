## API Information

This game uses the Star Wars API (https://akabab.github.io/starwars-api/) to fetch character data including:
- Character names
- Character images (GUI version only)
- Character IDs for matching

If the API is unavailable, the game will fall back to a predefined set of Star Wars characters.

## Technical Details

- **Grid Size**: 6x6 (36 cards)
- **Total Pairs**: 18 pairs of characters
- **API Endpoint**: `https://akabab.github.io/starwars-api/api/all.json`
- **Image Loading**: Dynamic loading from character image URLs
- **Matching Logic**: Based on character ID comparison

## Troubleshooting

1. **Import errors**: Make sure pygame and requests are installed
2. **Slow loading**: Character images are downloaded on startup (GUI version)
3. **API issues**: Game will use fallback characters if API is unavailable
4. **Display issues**: Try the text version if GUI has problems
