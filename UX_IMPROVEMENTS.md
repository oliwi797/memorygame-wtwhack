        flip_speed = 0.01 * dt
        # Smooth transition logic
```

### State Management
```python
# Clean separation of concerns
class GameState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
        self.flipped_cards = []
        self.game_statistics = Statistics()
```

### Event System
```python
# Responsive event handling
pygame.time.set_timer(pygame.USEREVENT + 1, 1000)  # Delayed match check
```
